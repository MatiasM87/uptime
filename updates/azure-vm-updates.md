## Notes

- `assessment_warning` usually means Azure completed the assessment but the Linux patch extension reported package-level errors. In this environment many are Ubuntu `Security-ESM` packages that require Ubuntu Pro/ESM or an OS upgrade path.
- `updates_pending` means Azure has assessed pending updates. This workflow does not apply them.
- Missing VMs are VMs without a recent Azure patch assessment result in Resource Graph.
